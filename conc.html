    <p>Canada's Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, had supported the air training scheme throughout the commonwealth in 1939, but its main and largest component was Canada. More than 131 000 airmen were trained in Canada and almost many Canadians served abroad in RAF organizations, as well. Due to french Canada's lack of enthusiasm for the war, Quebec participated least in the war. In the beginning of the war, Mackenzie King passed bill 80, which allowed conscription for oversea servives by Quebec, but later he had to invoke bill 80, due to the unexpected high casualties and need of commitment of man power for RCAF and RCN and therefore 12 908 French Canadians were sent overseas to fight, known as "zombies". </p>
    
    <p>Therefore, it is possible to conclude, that without Canada's role in WWII, it would have been tough for allied powers to gain victory over axis. Canada had a great role in WWII, which shall not be forgotten and hence should be honoured to respect the sacrifices, such as Leonard Birchall, who died while fighting for his country, alongside many of the other Canadian men and women who became immortal due to their great passion and love for their nation.</p>
