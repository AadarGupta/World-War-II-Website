<p>The Canadian Prime Minister at the time of the second world war, William Lyon Mackenzie King, believed that "the power of the airplane in determining ultimate victory," which was a sign of the war effort. The war effort of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) was very much affected by the management of British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. During the wartime, RCAF consisted of three parts, two of which were in Canada (The British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and Home War Establishment), consisted of 37 squadrons for coastal defence, protection of shipping and air defence. The third part was at London headquarters (The Overseas War Establishment). Canadian airmen served under the basis of mainly Britain's Royal Air Force, but also served in the bases of North Africa, Italy, Northwest Europe and Southeast Asia. By the end of the war, RAF had in total 48 squadrons. This plan was run by Britain's Royal Air Force, but many Canadians served in these units.</p>

<h1 class="hd">Victories</h1>
    
<p>Before the end of the war, the Canadian air force had grown to become the fourth largest service of the world. During the war, Germans surrendered due to 48 RCAF squadrons, mainly manned by Canadian officers and men. One of the milestone was the creation of number six RCAF on 1st January 1943, which consisted of 14 squadrons. During the second world war, four Canadian airmen were awarded Victoria Cross for their bravery, three were able to attend the service in Europe. During the air battle, between March 5th and June 24th, 1943 against Germany, around 10 000 Canadians lost their life, and their suffered high casualty, due to the lack of training and experience, in the command of Air Vice-Marshalls, GE Brooks and CM McEwen. By mid 1944, under the command of Brooks and McEwen, the situation was reversed with the help of better equipment, training, experience and was able to boost the lowest casualties in a group of bomber command.    </p>
    
<p>During the war period, another seven RCAF squadrons had served in the RAF's coastal command and was able to destroy 20 enemy submarines. In total, during World War II, 232 632 men and 17 030 women served in the RCAF, and approximately 17 101 lost their lives.</p>
    
<p>Home war establishment reached its maximum strength in November 1942, with 19 in Eastern air command and 18 in Western air command. British Commonwealth Air Training Plan was converted into Canadian RCAF, later termed as air drome of democracy, as agreement was signed on December 1939.</p>
    
<h1 class="hd">Struggles</h1>
    
<p>RCAF contributed majorly to Royal Air Force, almost 60% of RCAF personnel were with RAF squadrons. Around 93 844 personnel served overseas, for example, 1 out of 4 fighter pilots in the battle of Malta were Canadians, therefore 14 500 fatalities occured overseas.</p>
    
<p>4th April 1942 is known for the dramatic story of Canadian squadron leader Leonard Birchall, who spotted a Japanese fleet intending to attack allied forces on the island of Ceylon (Sri Lanka). He was the pilot of 413 Squadron Catalina Flying Boat, and kept an eye on the enemy and until his aircraft was shot down. It was very tragetic because Birchall was captured and held as a prisoner under Japanese for three years.</p>
