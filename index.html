<p>On 10th of September in the year 1939, Canada officially entered the second world war, and continued for nearly 6 years. This was the first and only time when Canada declared a war on another country, on their own behalf. The second world war was a transforming of Canadian history, as the country had become a critical player of the 20th century's most significant struggle. Between 1939 and 1945, almost one million Canadian men and women served for the country in the armed services and around 43 000 were killed. Although there was bloodshed, due to the war against Germany, still Canada developed its industrial base, which helped the economy. </p>

    <p>Unlike WWI, Canada did not automatically commit to war on Britain's declaration. In WWI, Canada was unprepared for war and had only 51 000 partly trained military forces. However, in WWII, they had enormous amounts of military forces. First of all, Canada took time to declare war and they had enormous man power for coastal defences, such as militia regiments. They mobilized their preperation intensely even before the outbreak of war. By 10th September, the declaration of war date, they already had 58 337 people enlisted for the purpose. By December, the first thousands were sailed to Britain, as the part of first Canadian infantry divison to serve overseas during the war. In Canada, recruiting was enhanced to prepare for armed forces and people served full time. One of the major breakthroughs, was in the Spring of 1944, where the Canadians were able to break the Hitler line barring the Liri Valley, under Lieutenant-General E.L.M. Burns. And in the final portion of the war in 1945, the First Canadian Corps, further fought their way across the Lombard Plain, under the command of Lieutenant-General Charles Foulkes. Around 92 757 Canadian soldiers of all different ranks were able to serve as a part of first Canadian army, and around 5 764 lost their lives during this war. First Canadian army were also able to push back Germans in the batte of Rhineland and Germans surrendered on May 5th at Field-Marshal Montgomery's front, when the second Canadian Corps took over Oldenburg and first Canadian Corps were already at Grebbe River line. This entire battle had cost the Canadian army 11 336 casualties. </p>
